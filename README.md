# NYC-Taxi---Exploratory-Data-Analysis
The NYC-Taxi data is an interesting big data problem. Here we try to solve some of the important questions in R as exploratory data analysis.

For more information about the dataset can be found from the below link.

Following are some of the questions addressed in this analysis:

Basic Questions<br>

a.	What is the distribution of number of passengers per trip?<br>
b.	What is the distribution of payment_type?<br>
c.	What is the distribution of fare amount?<br>
d.	What is the distribution of tip amount?<br>
e.	What is the distribution of total amount?<br>
f.	What are top 5 busiest hours of the day?<br>
g.	What are the top 10 busiest locations of the city?<br>
h.	Which trip has the highest standard deviation of travel time?<br>
i.	Which trip has most consistent fares?<br> 

Open Questions<br>

a.	In what trips can you confidently use respective means as measures of central tendency to estimate fare, time taken, etc.<br>
b.	Can we build a model to predict fare and tip amount given pick up and drop off coordinates, time of day and week?<br>
c.	If you were a taxi owner, how would you maximize your earnings in a day?<br>
d.	If you were a taxi owner, how would you minimize your work time while retaining the average wages earned by a typical taxi in the dataset?<br>
e.	If you run a taxi company with 10 taxis, how would you maximize your earnings?<br>
